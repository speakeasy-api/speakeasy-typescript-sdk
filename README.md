## Setting up

Feel free to use any system to manage your Node installing, but a `.nvmrc` is included in the library for `nvm` support.

To setup:

1. Install `nvm` following instructions on (nvm repo)[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm]
2. Install the correct node version with `nvm install`
3. Make sure the symlinks are correct with `nvm use`

## Formating, Linting & Testing

`prettier` is used with `husky` and `lint-staged` to lint on commit, which should be installed automatically by `npm`.

Use `yarn test` to run the test suite.
